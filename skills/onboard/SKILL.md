description: Onboard the current repository to the sentinel security-audit kit, once per repo - adds the kit as the .sentinel submodule, writes THREAT-MODEL.md from the code, the security-guidance rules, fuzz targets, deny.toml, the fast CI workflow and SECURITY.md, stopping after each step. Run only on an explicit /snt:onboard.

# Onboard this repo to sentinel

The steps live in the sentinel kit itself, so they always match the files they copy.

1. If `.sentinel/` does not exist, add the kit as a git submodule: `git submodule add https://github.com/jcrenshaw-dev/sentinel .sentinel`. Do not commit it.
2. Read `.sentinel/skills/onboard/steps.md` in full and follow it exactly. Its first step treats an existing `.sentinel/` as already added and covers the rest of setting up the kit.
3. If that file does not exist, the kit is older than this plugin, and in it `.sentinel/skills/onboard/SKILL.md` holds the full steps: read it in full and follow it exactly instead.
